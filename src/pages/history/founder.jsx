            FATHER SEAMUS’S OBITUARY <br />
            (Composed by his nieces Susanna Kuebler and Caryn Kuebler)
            </h1>

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6 text-[#4f42b5] ">
            Rev. A. Seamus of Jesus Conniff Kuebler, O.S.A. Prim. entered eternal life on April 9,
2019. Born Charles Anthony Kuebler in Wilkes-Barre, PA on July 1, 1948, he graduated
from Sacred Heart High Scholl in Plains, PA in 1966. But not before becoming the
youngest person- at the age of 15- to graduate and receive a guide dog from the Seeing
Eye in Morristown, NJ. He earned his undergraduate degree in theology from King’s
College in Wilkes-Barre in 1970 and continued his graduate studies at the Catholic
University of America in Washington, D. C. before transferring to the University of
Notre Dame in South Bend, IN, as a seminarian at Moreau Seminary.

            Father Seamus was called to religious life before losing his sight at a young age. His
spiritual vision far surpassed any physical limitation, and his determination to serve God
helped him inspire and guide others, including Pope Paul VI who granted special
permission for Father Seamus to be ordained to the priesthood on September 27, 1975, in
Washington, D. C. by the Archbishop, the late William Cardinal Baum, S.T.D.. Father
Seamus served in the Archdiocese of Washington and in the Diocese of Scranton, PA.
While in Scranton, he served as a parish minister and a Chaplain at St. Joseph’s Center in
Scranton- at the time a home for unwed mothers, an adoption agency, and a home for the
neurologically impaired. During these formative years of his professed service to God,
Father Seamus, through his inspired storytelling and energetic personality, found unique
ways to bring people closer to Jesus and make all feel welcome. His devotion to justice
and mercy inspired many young people around him and in turn brought to the Lord many
spiritual sons and daughters.

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6 text-[#4f42b5] ">
            In 1988, Father Seamus reaffirmed his calling to God and entered the International
Augustinian Novitiate, and prepared for the foundation of the Mother of the Good
Shepherd Monastery. On October 13, 1989, Father Seamus professed his first vows as an

Augustinian Monk of the Primitive Observance, and on August 17, 1996, he professed
solemn vows. His monastery was established to live the Augustinian monastic life as
established by the community’s Holy Father St. Augustine of Hippo, and to pray for the
priest.

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6 text-[#4f42b5] ">
            As abbot, Father Seamus devoted his life to the monastery and its vocations to give
oneself to God through monastic life by being one in mind and heart with his fellow
monks. Father Seamus’s mission, including his steadfast and much-beloved brother in
prayer for 26 years, Brother Nicholas of the Immaculate Heart, as well as Brothers
Augustine and Joseph.

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6 text-[#4f42b5] ">
            Father Seamus was a man of great playfulness and humor who enjoyed putting on accents
and inventing characters as part of a rich storytelling tradition. A practical joker, he could
be seen riding a bicycle or driving a car (to be astonishment of passersby), teaching his
guide dog to bow before the altar or growl when asked to dance. Father also had a great
love of music, often writing his own pieces. He was well versed on the piano, organ, and
guitar, and loved lifting his voice in song. He found great joy in dancing, being by the
ocean, and of course, storytelling.

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6 text-[#4f42b5] ">
            In fact, it is because of his rich life, the ways in which he reached people, and made
connections everywhere he went that makes it is so difficult to capture his essence and
the impact he’s had on so many of us in a few short paragraphs. In truth, many of his
family and friends have worked collectively to provide this brief glimpse into a life only
he could describe best, with his tremendous capacity to recall not only dates but the
moments that made those dates so special. Father Seamus was truly larger than life, and
his playfulness, infectious laughter, and deep devotion to others will be carried on by all
around him.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6 text-[#4f42b5] ">
            Father Seamus was a shepherd of people and animals alike, who were never far from his
embrace. As a child, he would baptize his birds, and he developed loving companionships
with many seeing-eye dogs over the years. Father Seamus leaves behind his playful and

faithful guide dog, a beautiful yellow lab, Fiona; a pack of pugs-Agnes, Martha, Maggie,
Peter, and Tommy; a distinguished German Shepard, Katie Rose; and the monastery’s
newest addition, a chihuahua, Aloysius. When times were tough, how often he would say.
“But thank God for the dogs!” Along with his beloved dogs, Father will also be missed
by the Monastery’s many farm animals and birds.
            </p>



            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6 text-[#4f42b5] ">
            In addition to his monastic family, Father Seamus is survived by his nieces, Susanna
Rose Kuebler and husband Oscar Galindo (Arlington VA) and Caryn Elizabeth Kuebler
(Hyattsville, MD); sisters-in-law, Yvonne “Bonnie” Kuebler (Calgary) and Sue Ellen
Coleman; step-niece, Heather Klees (William) and their four children, Avery, Natalie,
Emma, and Alan; several beloved cousins; and a strong church community. Father
Seamus now rejoins his parents-Elizabeth Frances Conniff and Edward Alfred Kuebler
and his brother, Edward James Kuebler.

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6 text-[#4f42b5] ">
            In the spirit of faith and prayer and to honor Father Seamus’s devoted mission, we ask
that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Mother of the Good Shepherd Monastery
or a service organization of your choice. The family also kindly asks that you consider
making a donation of blood to your local blood bank in Father Seamus’s memory.
