              WHO ARE THE AUGUSTINIAN MONKS AND WHAT IS THEIR VOCATION
            </h1>

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6">
              The Augustinian Monks of the Primitive Observance is a monastic
              community of Roman Catholic men, following the example of the
              fourth-century monk, priest and bishop, St. Augustine of Hippo,
              and living under his monastic Rule. Monasticism is a treasured
              heritage of the Catholic Faith and has vitalized the Church since
              ancient times. Augustine cultivated the seed of monasticism in the
              West, and saw the primitive Christian community, as painted in
              Acts 2:42-47, as the ideal for monasteries. His Holy Rule begins,
              "You have come together to be one in mind and heart, intent upon
              God." (Rule 1:3).
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6">
              St. Augustine found that the answer to his restless heart was
              falling in love with the Lord Himself. After his conversion in
              386, St. Augustine, along with his beloved friend St. Alypius, his
              son Adeodatus and others, embraced the monastic life, living
              simply in common with his brothers, apart from the world. Being
              one in mind and heart, they searched for God through the study of
              Scripture, the prayer of contemplation, and the punctuation of the
              day with the celebration of the Church's Liturgy. This is the life
              the monks seek to embrace with St. Augustine. Since the time of
              St. Augustine himself there have been monks, nuns, friars,
              sisters, and hermits who have followed his Rule and his example.

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6">
              The most important factor in the life of the monk is prayer. The
              source and summit of each day is the Eucharistic Sacrifice. The
              celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours at several appointed times
              throughout the day is integral to the monastic life. Rising early
              every day, the monks praise God in chant and intercede for the
              needs of the Church and the world, especially for all priests.
              Each day we offer our prayers and sacrifices for the salvation of
              all as we remember those who have asked us to pray for their
              physical, mental and spiritual health. We receive calls, letters
              and emails from people all over the world requesting our prayers.
              We especially keep those in DeLand, at St. Peter's and in our
              Diocese of Orlando in our prayers and sacrifices. Silent
              meditation and the reading of Holy Scripture, "Lectio Divina," are
              a sacred part of the life of contemplation. These allow the monk
              time to realize a deeper sense of the Lord's presence, listening
              to his voice and drawing ever closer to Him.

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6">
              Relying completely on Divine Providence, we support ourselves with
              our prayer enrollment cards, our small gift shop, donations, and
              fundraisers. We are very grateful for the generosity of those who
              sacrifice in order to help us in our monastic life.

              Augustinians Monks of the Primitive Observance consecrate their
              monastic vocation to the care and protection of the Mother of God.
              They constantly invoke her powerful intercession for all those
              entrusted to their prayers, all who have asked for their
              intercession and for all priests. Our monastery, dedicated to the
              Mother of God under the titular of Mother of the Good Shepherd, is
              situated in the hamlet of Glenwood in DeLand, Florida. The monks
              are bound by the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience; we have
              a special charism to pray for and serve priests. Because we are in
              a new location, we are striving to build a chapel and guest house
              and to convert our existing buildings into a suitable Monastery.
