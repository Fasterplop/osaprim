              Augustinian Charism

            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6">
              The foundation and characteristic of Augustinian life is life in
              common, in which friars seek to construct a path that is directed
              to God in service to others. We do this not only through the
              sharing of ideals and values, but also in the communion of all our
              material and spiritual goods. In this way we strive to grow
              through the gift of God's grace, and so give witness to the
              mystery of the Trinity and of the Church, anticipating now on
              earth the reality we hope for in the future in the Fatherâ€™s house.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6">
              The opening words of Saint Augustine's Rule give us direction: we
              are to be of one mind and heart on the way to God. We are
              travelers on pilgrimage together, wherein Christ is our constant
              companion, as well as our way and our goal.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify font-normal indent-6 my-6">
              The activity of our journey is shaped by Augustine's own
              experience and counsel, and is characterized by three essential
              elements: the constant search for God by means of a deep interior
              life; the practical love of neighbor; and the constant pursuit of
              truth.
